I am currently a part-time PhD student in Computer Science at University of Birmingham, under the supervision of [[Dr. Hyung Jin Chang] (https://hyungjinchang.wordpress.com/)] and [[Prof. Ales Leonardis] (https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~leonarda/)]. In parallel to my studies, I am a PLD Engineer at BAE Systems.

My research interests lie within the areas of Machine Learning, Transfer Learning, Representation Learning and Computer Vision.

I originally studied Engineering Science at New College, University of Oxford. My Master's thesis focused on acoustic perception in mobile robotics using Deep Learning.
