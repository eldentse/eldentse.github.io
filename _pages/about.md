I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at University of Birmingham, under the supervision of [Dr. Hyung Jin Chang](https://hyungjinchang.wordpress.com/) and [Prof. Ales Leonardis](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~leonarda/).

My research interests lie within the areas of Machine Learning, Representation Learning and Computer Vision.

I originally studied Engineering Science at New College, University of Oxford. My Master's thesis focused on acoustic perception in mobile robotics using Deep Learning.
