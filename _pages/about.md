<!-- <h3>About Me</h3> -->
I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at National University of Singapore, working on 3D scene understanding with humans under the mentorship of [Angela Yao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ayao/). I previously obtained my PhD at University of Birmingham, under the supervision of [Hyung Jin Chang](https://hyungjinchang.wordpress.com/), [Kwang In Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/kimki) and [Aleš Leonardis](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~leonarda/). My research focused on 3D human pose and body shape estimation from images. During my PhD, I have also interned at Google, hosted by [Bardia Doosti](https://bardiadoosti.github.io/) and [Danhang Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9uxs6G4AAAAJ&hl=en).

<!-- My research interests lie within the areas of Computer Vision and Graph Neural Networks. I am particularly interested in 3D computer vision, especially perceiving everyday's human interaction with objects. -->

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and graphics. I am particularly interested in building a system that can capture and preceive how humans interact with the dynamic 3D world from everyday photographs and videos. 

I originally studied Engineering Science at New College, University of Oxford. My Master's thesis focused on acoustic perception in mobile robotics at [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/).
